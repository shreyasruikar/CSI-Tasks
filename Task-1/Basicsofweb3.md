## Blockchain Fundamentals

### Basics of Blockchain

1. **What is Blockchain?**
   - Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger among computer network nodes.
   - It is a type of distributed database.
   - Each block consists of cryptographic hash, timestamp, and information about other blocks.

2. **History**
   - Traces of a concept similar to blockchain date back to 1982 when 'David Chaum' proposed a similar protocol.
   - The first decentralized blockchain technology was conceptualized by 'Satoshi Nakamoto' in 2008.
   - The last 10 years have seen revolutionary growth in this technology.

3. **Purpose & Key Concepts**
   - Blockchain simplifies transactions and provides end-to-end security.
   - It facilitates lending, borrowing, and insurance through smart contracts.
   - Blockchain ensures transparency in insurance claims.
   - It can be used for hassle-free voting to prevent duplicate votes.

### Blockchain Mining

- Blockchain mining is a peer-to-peer computer process used to secure and verify Bitcoin transactions.
- Bitcoin transactions are verified in decentralized systems through mining.

#### Types of Mining:

1. **Individual Mining**
   - Miners work individually to validate transactions.

2. **Pool Mining**
   - Groups of users collaborate to validate transactions and share rewards.

3. **Cloud Mining**
   - Hassle-free method that eliminates the need for hardware and software.

### Cryptography & Hashing

- Cryptography secures data against unauthorized access.
- Hashing secures block information and links blocks in blockchain.

#### Applications of Cryptography:

1. Password Encryption.
2. Cryptocurrencies.
3. Internet Security.
4. Online Authentication.
5. End-to-end authentication.

#### Types of Cryptography:

1. **Symmetric-key**
   - Focuses on using the same key for encryption and decryption.

2. **Asymmetric key**
   - Uses different keys for encryption and decryption.

### Consensus Protocols

- Consensus protocols are rules that govern how blockchain works.

#### What it does?
- Prevents a single entity from taking control.
- Allows users to trust each other without a controlling third party.

### Blockchain Interoperability

- Interoperability enables blockchains to communicate with each other.

#### Importance
- Success depends on how different networks can interact and integrate.

#### Solutions
- Current solutions include Cosmos, Polkadot, Harmony, Wanchain, Chainlink, Hybrix, and Loom Network.

### Blockchain Fork

- Forks occur when blockchain miners' software becomes misaligned.

- **Hard Forks vs. Soft Forks**
   - Hard forks create a new version of blockchain.
   - Soft forks are backwards-compatible and require miners' majority to upgrade.

### Structure of a Typical Blockchain

1. **Header**: Identifies a block in the blockchain.
2. **Previous Block Address/Hash**: Connects blocks using a hash.
3. **Timestamp**: Assigns a creation time/date for digital documents.
4. **Nonce**: Central to Proof-of-Work.
5. **Merkel Root**: Stores all transactions in a block.

### Token Standards

- Token standards dictate how a crypto token works.
- Common token standards include ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-777, and ERC-1155.

### What is Gas & Gas Fees? (Ethereum)

- Gas is the fee required for transactions or contract execution on Ethereum.
- The gas price is determined by supply, demand, and network capacity.
